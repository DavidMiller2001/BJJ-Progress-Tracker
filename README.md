# Bjj Progress Tracker

## TODO

- [x] Make update form (refactor to a single form component that takes in props to determine what kind of form it is?)
- [x] Make form dialog reusable for both the create and update forms
- [x] State management solution to avoid a bunch of prop drilling (zustand or jotai are ones I've heard of but need more research)
- [x] Dynamic routes for individual events
- [ ] Some sort of list view to easier see all events by a given date or event
- [ ] Color code dates in the calendar with any associated events
- [ ] Hosting (probably just vercel)
